Forked from the [official Snes9x repo](https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x).

Compile the Windows version yourself from the source code, or download the executable [here](https://github.com/cptnoremac/snes9x/raw/master/snes9x-flipflop.zip). Be sure countdown.wav is in the same directory as the executable, or you'll get a default Windows sound instead. If you don't like the sound, you can make your own. Just name it countdown.wav and put it in the same directory and it will work.
